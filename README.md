This is meant to be kind of a joke; I am doing this to see how far I can go after I placed on the global leaderboard twice two years ago; those are my only global ranks, and they were both achieved using some combination of Excel and/or manual solve. 

General rules
- No VBA, just pure Excel formulas for calculations
- The one exception is that I will allow myself to use a text editor with regex find/replace in order to format things nicely into CSV to import into Excel
